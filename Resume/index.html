        <h3>Sports</h3>
        I'm originally from Lawrenceville a suburb of Atlanta where I grew up.
        Growing up I spent a lot of time playing sports and music.
        I've been a swimmer since I was three years old. Over the Years I swam on summer leagues and on the
        high school team.I even got the honor of being the Swim Captain my senior year and recieve the "Tiger award"
        an award given for the most dedicated swimmer physically and academically.
        I also spent multiple years playing lacrosse starting with 8th grade and ending my junior year of high school.

        <h3>Music</h3>
        Music has always been an intrigal part of my life. I grew up in a home that it was more important to have
        a music room with a baby grand than a dining room. My dad would play and fill my home with sounds that can only described
        as heavenly. When I was 7 my parents starting me out with the piano which to this day is my preferred
        instrument. In middle school I picked up the violin and I played in the orchestra for multiple years.
        In high school I joined the marching band playing the Synthesizer. My senior year of high school I started playing
        organ. While I'd I wouldn't consider myself the next Bach I learned enough to be able to play for my church's
        congregation.

        <h3>Mission</h3>
        In my Life, I have had some unique opportunities. My Mission being one of those.In 2016 as a 18 year old I left my home
        and became a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in Chile. I arrived in Santiago
        in january where I received language. In Febuary I left and for the next two years spent all my time
        trying to serve others in many different places from  as south as Vina Del Mar and as north as La Serena.
        I loved my Mission. I learned so many things from Spanish to basic life skills. I also met some of the
        most kind and genuine people on the planet.
